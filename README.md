## Introduction

This is a simple script that generates an ebook of your tweets archive. 
The motivation behind this project was to have a physical copy of my tweets, since I moved away from Twitter (now X).

Uses fonts that support Greek and Japanese (CJK) characters, as well as emojis.

## Usage
Download your tweets archive from Twitter (it might take a while).
Save the archive in the same folder as this script.
Change the `configuration.py` dictionary to your liking, especially `data_path` to reflect the path to your tweets archive.  
Then, just run the script.
```bash
python tweets2ebook.py 
```
